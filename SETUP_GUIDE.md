## üéØ What's Now Working

### ‚úÖ Real Database Integration
- Content is now stored and retrieved from Supabase
- User consumption tracking
- Real-time content pool management

### ‚úÖ AI Content Generation
- Edge Functions deployed and ready
- Automatic content generation when pool runs low
- Gemini AI integration (when API key is provided)

### ‚úÖ Smart Content Management
- Content automatically generates when you consume 5+ pieces
- Different content types (video scripts vs text snippets)
- Subject and difficulty-based content filtering

### ‚úÖ User Analytics
- Tracks what content users consume
- Completion percentage tracking
- Usage-based content generation triggers

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables
Your `.env` file should have:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://mmwtiqhowrconndntekz.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
```

### Edge Function Environment Variables (Set in Supabase Dashboard)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Automatically provided
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Automatically provided

## üé® Content Generation Prompts

The AI generates content using these prompts:

### Video Script Prompt:
```
Generate a [difficulty] level [subject] coding tutorial script for a 60-90 second video.
Format as JSON with title, script, codeExample, keyPoints, difficulty, and estimatedDuration.
Make it engaging, practical, and perfect for short-form video content.
```

### Text Snippet Prompt:
```
Create a [difficulty] level [subject] coding explanation that takes 60-90 seconds to read.
Format as JSON with title, content, codeExample, keyTakeaways, difficulty, and estimatedReadTime.
Focus on one specific concept with practical application.
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Make sure you ran the SQL setup script completely
- Check that RLS policies are enabled
- Verify your Supabase credentials in `.env`

### Content Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Edge Functions are deployed
- Make sure database tables exist

### AI Generation Not Working
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in Supabase Edge Functions environment
- Check Edge Function logs in Supabase dashboard
- Fallback to mock content generation if API fails

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Content Pool Status
```sql
SELECT subject, difficulty_level, COUNT(*) as content_count
FROM ai_content_pool 
WHERE is_active = true 
GROUP BY subject, difficulty_level;
```

### View User Consumption
```sql
SELECT subject, difficulty_level, COUNT(*) as consumed_count
FROM user_content_consumption 
GROUP BY subject, difficulty_level;
```

## üéâ Success!

Once setup is complete, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ Real database-backed content
- ‚úÖ AI-powered content generation
- ‚úÖ User tracking and analytics
- ‚úÖ Automatic content pool management
- ‚úÖ Instagram Reels-style learning experience

The app will now intelligently generate fresh content based on user behavior while keeping the AI completely hidden from the user experience!
